title:  "UT61E Bluetooth 4.0 Mod (HM-11)"
categories: multimeter
---
This post shows how the Uni-T UT61E multimeter can be modded to use the integrated data logging port over Bluetooth 4.0 (low energy), for example in the field with a laptop or smartphone!

I used the HM-11 module, but this also works with the HM-10 and should also work with almost all other modules. At least Bluetooth 4.0 standard is highly recommended, because of the lower power consumption. 
The HM-11 draws about 9 mA from the 3.3V rail, the UT61 uses linear regulators so that is the same on the 9V level (directly from the battery), which gives with a typical 200mAh battery about 20h runtime.

### HM-11 Setup

This shows the module from the backside, only 4 pins are needed for this project, power `GND` `VCC` and the serial port `UART_RX` `UART_TX`.
The multimeter chipset (Cyrustek ES51922) provides a serial interface with 19200 baudrate and the BLE modules are usually set to 9600 baudrate from the factory, so before you can connect this must be adapted.

Configuration is done with AT commands on this BLE module, to set the baudrate to 19200 send over serial:
```
AT+BAUD1
```
and it should return: `OK+Set:2`
